# Random Restaurant Generator - React

This [Random Restaurant Generator](https://www.amberalter.com/fun/random-restaurant-generator/) was built to help my spouse and I choose a restaurant when we are being indecisive.

## Specs

- Written in REACT, converted from vanilla JS [view original project](https://github.com/amalter/random-restaurant-generator-vanilla) .
- Pulls data from [Google Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qXVoKMWnMvdVq2fhikqdwgSbVo86VVfFoOfDuwg5bPs/edit?usp=sharing) containing vegan-friendly restaurants in the Seattle Region.

### Known bugs/ TODO:

- prevent button click if neither neighborhood or cuisine has been selected
- If select all is selected, then select another item, select all should be cleared
